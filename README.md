# RPG Tutorial Series - Gorka Games (with Personal Ideas and Bug Fixes)

This is an ongoing project based on the **RPG Tutorial Series by Gorka Games**. Currently, I am following the tutorial to build the foundations of an RPG. While the project is still largely based on the tutorial content, I am actively incorporating some small ideas and improvements into the game mechanics to add some personal touch.

**Note:** This is still a work-in-progress project. It is **not finished** and contains many features that still need improvement or addition.

## Project Description

The **RPG Tutorial Series by Gorka Games** provides a detailed guide to creating a classic RPG in **Unreal Engine**. I have followed the tutorialâ€™s steps to build a functional RPG system but have also introduced several of my own ideas. These ideas include:

- **Vaulting with Motion Warp**: A system that allows the character to vault over obstacles with smooth transitions, driven by Motion Warp.
- **Assassination with Motion Warp**: A feature that enables the character to eliminate enemies in a realistic manner up close, using Motion Warp for seamless animations.
- **Combat System**: A basic combat system that allows the player to fight with different weapons, with realistic hit reactions and damage mechanics.
- **Locking onto Enemies**: A function that allows the player to focus on an enemy, improving control and orientation during combat.
- **Sound Integration**: Implemented sound effects for various actions, such as attacks, movements, and environmental sounds.
- **Leveling and XP System**: A system that allows characters to gain experience and level up, enhancing progression within the game.
- **Equipment System**: An equipment system is being developed, allowing the player to equip weapons, armor, and other items.

These personal contributions and improvements are intended to enhance the gameplay and bring a unique spin to the RPG experience.
